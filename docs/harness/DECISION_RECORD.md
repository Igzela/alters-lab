## Decisions

### Decision ALT-002-01: Phase 0 intake remains file-based

**Date**: 2026-05-19
**Status**: accepted
**Context**: ALT-002 implements the snapshot intake workflow. The question was whether to introduce any application code for intake or keep it file-based.
**Decision**: Phase 0 intake remains entirely file-based. No backend, frontend, database, or LLM provider code. The intake workflow is a manual process documented in intake-workflow.md, with snapshot.yaml as the sole output artifact.
**Consequences**: Intake is slower and requires manual effort, but keeps Phase 0 scope minimal and avoids premature complexity. The workflow can be automated in later phases once the file-based process is validated.
**Alternatives**: Build a CLI intake tool (deferred to later phases). Build a web intake form (deferred to later phases).

### Decision ALT-003-01: Branch discovery uses three-step pipeline

**Date**: 2026-05-19
**Status**: accepted
**Context**: ALT-003 defines how snapshot anchors are transformed into structural branches. The question was how to structure the transformation process.
**Decision**: Branch Discovery uses a three-step pipeline: (1) Tension Extraction — identify irreducible tensions from snapshot anchors, (2) Structural Branch Identification — generate candidate branches that represent active structural choices, (3) Convergence — reduce to 3-4 mutually incompatible branches. The pipeline is documented, not automated.
**Consequences**: The three-step structure provides clear traceability from snapshot to branches. Each step has defined inputs and outputs, making it auditable. The convergence step enforces quality by filtering out result-only and parameter-only differences.
**Alternatives**: Single-step branch generation (rejected — too opaque, hard to audit). Two-step pipeline (rejected — tension extraction and structural identification are distinct cognitive operations).

### Decision ALT-003-02: Branch template includes invalid_if field

**Date**: 2026-05-19
**Status**: accepted
**Context**: ALT-003 defines the canonical branch structure. The question was whether branches should include pre-defined conditions that would invalidate them.
**Decision**: Each branch includes an `invalid_if` field — a list of observable conditions that would prove the branch wrong within 30 days. This enables the Calibration system (ALT-007) to score branches against reality.
**Consequences**: Branches are falsifiable from the start. This prevents wishful thinking and ensures branches can be evaluated against real outcomes. The invalid_if field must be filled with concrete, observable conditions, not vague hopes.
**Alternatives**: Omit invalid_if (deferred to Calibration phase) — rejected because making branches falsible upfront improves branch quality and prevents unfalsifiable branches.
